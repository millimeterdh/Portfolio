I have recently imigrated to the united stated and am persuing a certificate in software development to strenthen my skillset and also secure a promising future in this new country. Presently I am working at amazon Logistics as a warehouse assosiate.
  <br><br><br>
  My journey so far has lead me to the united states where i see alot of opportunity and to better menifest my potential I assessed that i needed to extend my portfolio of skills to match the requirements of the every evolving future that we are experiencing. Working at Amazon I saw an openning that allows Amazon employees to develop careers in a vast array of professional industries and one of them was IT, where I feel there is the most potential. So after working at amazon for more than a year I was elligible to apply for a Software developer programe with correlation one and become a software Developer. This will help me apply all my previous experience and whatever I learn now to build upon my future success in my journey towards becoming a progressive part of society and also help my family in securing a stable future.</footer> <br><br>
